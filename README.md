    <h1>Gorillaz are Forever</h1>
  
    <p>
      Damon Albarn is the Mastermind behind the infamous Gorillaz Featuring the fictonal characters 2-D Pot, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, 
      Russel Hobbs with which he has created multiple "in my opinion" the greatest peices of musical genius the world has yet to fully appreciate and give credit where credit is do. 
      So this website is dedicated to the Gorillaz the greatest band that never existed.
      Created in 1998 the gorillaz are still making new tracks to this day involving lots of collaborations with a wide rang of genres and musicans.
     Side Note The Gorillaz were orginally formed with artist Jamie Hewlett who does all of the Art work but the music contribution in the beginning was only Mr. Albarn.
      Nowadays though the band has a contirbuting drummer Remi Kabaka Sr. who also contributes the voice for band member Russel Hobbs.
      With the way Covid-19 has affected the world as a whole and things are not the same as they were just one year ago but the gorillaz have mixed up how they release there music and released tracks througout the last year and let us follow 
      until they actual droped there New Album, Song Machine which is in my opinion one of my favorites from them.
